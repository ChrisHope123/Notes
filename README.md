Notes taken by me or available to me while attending ELTE Faculty of Informatics.   
Sometimes the formatting can be off because Github's markdown render is not the same one I use.
**I advise against learning purely from these notes**

To edit the notes I recommend using the Markdown Preview Enhanced extension by Yiyi Wang
